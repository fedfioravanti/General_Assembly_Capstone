## Overview

This project was completed as the final capstone of my Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly in London.  
This document explains the background, the objectives, the methodologies, the conclusions and the tools used. The topic of flight delays was selected due to personal and professional interests within the aviation industry.

## Background

Flight delays are not only painful for passengers, they are also a major problem for airlines.  
Flights departing after a 15-minute "grace period" are considered delayed, representing on average 21% of the total. The average delay costs the company about $1,100 USD per flight. Fuel and crew costs are, by far, the largest cost driver, followed by aircraft maintenance and ownership.  
Delays also drive the need for additional airport gates and ground staff and impose costs on airline customers in the form of lost productivity, wages and goodwill.
The aviation ecosystem would be really interested in finding the factors that have the biggest impact on flight delays, so that they can be addressed from an operational point of view. In this scenario, it is important to analyse an international airport connected to a large number of destinations.  

<br/><br/>

## Objectives

The goals of this project is to create a classification model which can:

- Identify the most important factors leading to a delayed flight.
- Provide insights to the airport operator in order to reduce the overall delays and improve business performance.  

<br/><br/>


## Data Collection

The data used for this project come from the operational database of a major international airport containing all the flights made in 2013. Furthermore, I collected the hourly meteorogical data from the Open-Meteo website.  
The raw data consisted of almost 195,000 flights and 39 features.  

<br/><br/>


## Data Preparation & Cleaning

The original operational database had many missing values, with several things to fix. Before merging it with the weather dataset, I had to make sure that both time columns used as keys were formatted the same.
All work was done in Python on Jupyter notebooks, and the processing revolved around:

* Identifying variables relevant to modelling, and which ones to drop.
* Creating datetime column objects.
* Interpreting continuous and categorical features.
* Converting several features into binary variables.
* Creating more model-friendly feature names.
* Translating some feature values into English.
* Exploring opportunities for new feature creation.
* Looking for erroneous or missing data.
* Creating the target variable.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  
![alt text](./images/01_heatmap_01.png "Heatmap of correlations between continuous variables")
![alt text](./images/04_boxplot_01.png "Box plots of continuous variables")

Initial EDA did not reveal meaningful correlations between the different variables and the delay.  
Some variables show a large amount of outliers, and delays account for roughly 17% of total flights, which is in line with industry average.

Flights are most frequent in August and least frequent in February during the year, showing a clear seasonality over the summer months.  
On average, flights are most frequent on Fridays and least frequent on Tuesdays during the week, with the daily peak being at 16:00 and the lowest at 03:00.

Before moving to the modelling stage, I explored some of the trends within the data, including the relative delays per hour, day, month, airline, aircraft type, service type, country of arrival and country of destination.

## Modelling

Since my target was categorical, the project was made into a classification problem with two rather unbalanced classes; the baseline accuracy, the percentage of the majority class, was 0.7375, which reflect a high skewness.
After dummification most predictors were categorical, however there were few continuous variables. I performed a stratified train/test split and rescaled the training set before running the models.  

A range of models were first tested on the dataset: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Naïve Bayes Classifier and Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier.

The best performing model in the first stage was Gradient Boosting Classifier, which achieved a CV score of 0.7756, and Logistic Regression was second best with a CV score of 0.7619.  

After the initial model testing I further investigated both models using GridSearchCV.
Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the final CV score of 0.7805 and tended to overpredict the majority class.

## Limitations

The main limitations to this project come from the original operational dataset: it contains some apparently contradictory features for which very little information is available.  
Another limitation of the dataset is that it did not include any information about the actual delay time, but we could only infer the flight status.  
Additional work could be aimed at matching every flight with the relative apron spot and gate in the terminal building: this could help in performing a geospatial analysis to improve efficiency of airport facilities.  


<br/><br/>

## Conclusion

The nature of this project was primarily exploratory, so no hypothesis were made about which factor could have the greatest impact on a delayed flight.  

The final parameters tuning using GridSearchCV gave an accuracy score of 0.7973 and a CV score of 0.7805: however the model was overfitting and biased towards the majority class, which showed a good precision score and a very good recall score. The average precision score and the bad recall score for the minority class confirmed the unbalanced behaviour of the model.  

The time of the flight and the baggage weight seem to be the most important factors in a delay, which was partly reflected in the previous EDA.  


<br/><br/>

## Future Work

To further improve the current work, the following steps should be taken:
* Feature Engineering, with the creation of additional features such as aircraft size category and aircraft typology.
* Imputing values where missing, to avoid the removal of entire observations.
* Removing outliers, after further analysis and due diligence of the plausible values.
* Splitting the dataset between arriving and departing flights, examining whether the accuracy and the effectiveness of the model could be enhanced.
* Employing XGBoost and additional classifiers, checking the effects on the model's performance.
