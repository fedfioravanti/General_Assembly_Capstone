# General_Assembly_Capstone
Capstone project for GA's Data Science Immersive course.

#### Background

Flight delays are not only painful for passengers, they are also a major problem for airlines.  
Flights departing after a 15-minute "grace period" are considered delayed, representing on average 21% of the total. The average delay costs the company about $1,100 USD per flight. Fuel and crew costs are, by far, the largest cost driver, followed by aircraft maintenance and ownership. 



#### Objectives

The goals of this project is to create a classification model which can:

- Identify the most important factors leading to a delayed flight.
- Provide insights to the airport operator in order to reduce the overall delays and improve business performance.


#### Data Source

The data used for this project come from the operational database of a major international airport containing all the flights made in 2013. Furthermore, I collected the hourly meteorogical data from the Open-Meteo website.
