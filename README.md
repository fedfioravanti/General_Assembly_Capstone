# General_Assembly_Capstone

## Overview
This project was completed as the final capstone of my Data Science Immersive bootcamp at General Assembly in London. This document explains the background, the objectives, the methodologies, the conclusions and the tools used. The topic of flight delays was selected due to personal and professional interests within the aviation industry.

## Background

Flight delays are not only painful for passengers, they are also a major problem for airlines.  
Flights departing after a 15-minute "grace period" are considered delayed, representing on average 21% of the total. The average delay costs the company about $1,100 USD per flight. Fuel and crew costs are, by far, the largest cost driver, followed by aircraft maintenance and ownership.  
Delays also drive the need for additional airport gates and ground staff and impose costs on airline customers in the form of lost productivity, wages and goodwill.
The aviation ecosystem would be really interested in finding the factors that have the biggest impact on flight delays, so that they can be addressed from an operational point of view. In this scenario, it is important to analyse an international airport connected to a large number of destinations. 



## Objectives

The goals of this project is to create a classification model which can:

- Identify the most important factors leading to a delayed flight.
- Provide insights to the airport operator in order to reduce the overall delays and improve business performance.


## Data Collection

The data used for this project come from the operational database of a major international airport containing all the flights made in 2013. Furthermore, I collected the hourly meteorogical data from the Open-Meteo website.  
The raw data consisted of almost 195,000 flights and 39 features.
